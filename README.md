🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher

Installation

Clone the repository:

bashgit clone https://github.com/igordobronx/banking-system.git
cd banking-system

Run the system:

bashpython bank.py
💻 Usage
The system provides an interactive menu with the following options:
1 - Create account
2 - Deposit
3 - Withdraw
4 - Transfer
5 - View account
6 - View all accounts
7 - Transaction history
8 - Apply interest (Savings only)
9 - Delete account
0 - Exit
Example Usage
Creating an account:
Choose option: 1
Holder name: John Doe
Account type (checking/savings): checking
Initial deposit: 1000.00
✅ Account #1001 created successfully!
Making a transfer:
Choose option: 4
From account: 1001
To account: 1002
Amount: 250.00
✅ Transfer completed successfully!
🏗️ Architecture
Class Hierarchy
Account (Base Class)
├── CheckingAccount
└── SavingsAccount

Bank (Manages accounts)
Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

Inheritance: CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount inherit from Account
Encapsulation: Private attributes with getter methods
Polymorphism: Overridden withdraw() method with different behaviors
Composition: Bank class contains and manages Account objects

📊 Features in Detail
Account Features

Auto-generated unique account numbers
Complete transaction history with timestamps
Balance validation before operations
Fee calculation and tracking

Checking Account Specifics

Overdraft Limit: R$ 500.00
Withdrawal Fee: R$ 2.50 per transaction
Available Balance: Regular balance + overdraft limit

Savings Account Specifics

Interest Rate: 0.5% monthly
Free Withdrawals: First 3 per month
Additional Withdrawal Fee: R$ 5.00
Interest Application: Can be applied monthly via menu

Data Persistence

Accounts are automatically saved to accounts.json
Data persists between sessions
Automatic loading on startup

🔒 Security Features

Balance validation before withdrawals
Overdraft limit enforcement
Account deletion requires zero balance
Transaction history for auditing

🧪 Testing
The system includes built-in validations:

Amount validation (must be positive)
Sufficient funds verification
Account existence checks
Transfer validation (both accounts must exist)

📝 Example Scenarios
Scenario 1: Regular Banking Operations
python# User creates checking account with R$ 1000
# Makes deposit of R$ 500 → Balance: R$ 1497.50 (R$ 2.50 fee)
# Withdraws R$ 300 → Balance: R$ 1195.00
# Transaction history shows all operations
Scenario 2: Overdraft Usage
python# Checking account balance: R$ 100
# Withdraws R$ 400 → Successful (uses R$ 300 from overdraft)
# New balance: -R$ 302.50 (includes R$ 2.50 fee)
Scenario 3: Savings Account Interest
python# Savings account balance: R$ 2000
# Apply interest → New balance: R$ 2010 (0.5% = R$ 10)
# Free withdrawal counter resets to 3
